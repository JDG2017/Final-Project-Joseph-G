        <p>Because of police brutality, many people have been mistreated and disregarded, and unfortunately, many have been killed in the process. One of those victims was Michael Brown, who was killed by a white police officer. 
        Another victim who passed away was a gentleman named Eric Garner. He was killed by a police officer who went behind him and proceeded to choke him. He was struggling to breathe. That's how the infamous phrase I CAN'T BREATHE came to be.  </p>
