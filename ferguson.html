       <p> Text about Ferguson. In Ferguson, Missouri, a young unarmed black man named Michael Brown was shot by a white police officer. He passed away not too long after that. As a result, there was retaliation and several protests broke out, demanding to put an end to police brutality.</p>
       <p>The other picture to the left is an example of the police brutality in Montreal, as you can see with 3-4 officers on one person when only a couple is neccessary.</p>
